# **App Name**: Resonance

## Core Features:

- Grid Display: Display a grid representing the Langton's Ant simulation space.
- Ant Simulation: Simulate the movement of Langton's ant based on its rules: turn right on white squares, turn left on black squares, flip the color of the square after moving.
- Simulation Controls: Implement controls to start, pause, and reset the simulation. Also, allow users to control the simulation speed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Grid color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for empty cells and dark gray (#333) for filled cells.
- Ant color: Red (#FF4500) to easily identify the ant's position.
- Accent: Blue (#007BFF) for interactive elements like buttons.
- Simple and clean layout with the grid occupying the majority of the screen.
- Simulation controls (start, pause, reset, speed) positioned below the grid.
- Smooth transitions for the ant's movement and color changes.
